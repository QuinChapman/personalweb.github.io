                <h3>Project Background</h3><hr><br>
                <p>For my capstone course I chose to participate in an undergraduate research opportunity under the guidance of two experienced HCI faculty - Dr. Wilson and PhD student, Johanna Okerlund.</p><br>
                <p>The goal of our research focused on investigating the impact of various physical/visual cues or objects in a makerspace or relative to a makerspace. It was most important that we considered 
                    the demographics of our subjects and how the environment of the makerspace would impact their decision-making.</p><br> 
                <p>Along the way I was tasked with completing CITI training for human subjects research, submitting our research application to UNCC's Institution Review Board, conducting literature reviews to understand relevant work, 
                    defining a specific research question, designing and rationalizing a set of visual cues to study, running both a pilot and final study, analyzing the results, and lastly, writing the final research paper.</p><br>
