                        <p>One common feature for many of these devices is the ability to share them with other people.
                            There are several types of people
                            you might want to share with: other people living in the home; visitors who are occasionally
                            in the home;
                            and people who may want to control some of these devices while not at home.</p><br>
                        <p>Most apps have some form of sharing interfaces, but many of these are overly simplistic, and
                            do not allow for the range of potential sharing users and use cases.</p><br>
                        <p>So, we crafted <b>iShare</b>, a simple and intuitive smart home sharing app designed to improve the
                            lives of everyday people,
                            like ourselves, and provide them with a much needed extra layer of security.</p>

                        <p>The general theme of our application was simple and intuitive. We wanted to ensure users weren’t overwhelmed by multiple features 
                            and chose to focus on making their experience learnable and predictable to create a sense of comfort when navigating throughout the app.</p><br> 
                        <p>We took inspiration from various other smart home apps such as Ring, Nest, and Apple Home and crafted a brief outline of 
                            certain essential features for our app. At this stage, crafting <b>iShare</b>'s overall user flow was pivotal in our creation of a low-fidelity prototype

                             alongside the total time it took for said tasks to be completed.</p><br>

                        <p>Being that a major pain point for users was centered around finding these specific functions, we made it our main focus in this iteration.

                        <p><b>iShare</b> was the first project we worked on that involved conceptualizing an app from scratch. Given we collectively learned about the UX design
                             process alongside completing this project, it was a great test of knowledge and dedication to creating a data-driven and impactful user experience. </p><br>
                        <p>Prior to this, we often failed to think of the underlying processes that this process entails, and through this project we learned more about the importance
                             of techniques such as wizard of oz, needfinding, and more, and how they are essential aspects of designing great user experiences.</p><br>
                        <p>We thoroughly enjoyed being a part of this process and all hope to continue growing in our knowledge of the UX Design process. Thanks for sticking around :) </p>
