                    <h3>Project Background</h3>
                    <hr style="width: 120px"><br>
                    <p>As part of my Human Centered Design course, we were tasked with completing a semester-long
                        project.</p><br>
                    <p>One common feature for many of these devices is the ability to share them with other people.
                        There are several types of people
                        you might want to share with: other people living in the home; visitors who are occasionally
                        in the home;
                        and people who may want to control some of these devices while not at home.</p><br>
                    <p>Most apps have some form of sharing interfaces, but many of these are overly simplistic, and
                        do not allow for the range of potential sharing users and use cases.</p><br>
                    <p>So, we crafted iShare, a simple and intuitive smart home sharing app designed to improve
                        the
                        lives of everyday people,
                        like ourselves, and provide them with a much needed extra layer of security.</p>

                    <hr style="width: 230px"><br>
                    <p>The general theme of our application was simple and intuitive. We wanted to ensure users weren’t
                        overwhelmed by multiple features
                        and chose to focus on making their experience as learnable and predictable to create a sense of
                        comfort when navigating throughout the app.</p><br>
                    <p>We took inspiration from various other smart home apps such as Ring, Nest, and Apple Home and
                        crafted a brief outline of
                        certain essential features for our app. At this stage, crafting iShare's overall user
                        flow was pivotal in our creation of a low-fidelity prototype
                        for user testing.</p>

                    <p>Before we could conduct user testing, we created a medium fidelity interactive prototype in
                        Google Slides.
                        This enabled us to guide users through iShare’s flow and gather data and feedback from

                    <p>After user testing, we went back to the drawing board to craft a medium-fidelity prototype to
                        address the pain points and feedback we received.</p><br>
                    <p>iShare’s main user tasks involved sharing access to smart home devices with other users
                        and interacting with more than one device. As a result of this,
                        we wanted the user to be able to accomplish these tasks in a centralized location; the home
                        screen. </p><br>
                    <p>Being that a major pain point for users was centered around finding these specific functions, we
                        made it our main focus in this iteration.
                        We wanted the visual design to be modern and simplistic to truly embody iShare’s moto of
                        creating a simple and intuitive space for users to interact with and explore.</p>

                    <hr><br>
                    <p>iShare was the first project we worked on that involved conceptualizing an app from
                        scratch. Given we collectively learned about the UX design
                        process alongside completing this project, it was a great test of knowledge and dedication to
                        creating a data-driven and impactful user experience. </p><br>
                    <p>Prior to this, we often failed to think of the underlying processes that this process entails,
                        and through this project we learned more about the importance
                        of techniques such as wizard of oz, needfinding, and more, and how they are essential aspects of
                        designing great user experiences.</p><br>
                    <p>We thoroughly enjoyed being a part of this process and all hope to continue growing in our
                        knowledge of the UX Design process. Thanks for sticking around! &#128513;</p>
